# node-shop
You could add, edit, delete your own products.  
You could only see your own products in the admin products page.  
You would receive an email when register, request password reset and upon successful reset.  
You can place your order. (minimun cost is $4 dollar).  
I am just using the development API from stripe, so no money would be deducted.  
Use 4242 4242 4242 4242 as the testing credit card with any CVV and date that is not expired.  
You could view your invoice on the order page after payment. Invoice in pdf format would be generated dynamically.  
I used AWS S3 to store images and Google App Engine to deploy this node.js application.
